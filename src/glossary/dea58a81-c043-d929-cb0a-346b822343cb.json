  "term": "smart contract",
  "definition": "smart contracts are contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.[85] One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. The IMF believes smart contracts based on blockchain technology could reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general.[86] Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status is unclear.[86]\n\nablockchain implementation that enables the coding of contracts that execute when specified conditions are met. A blockchain smart contract is enabled by logic that defines and executes an agreement. For example, Ethereum Solidity is an open-source blockchain project that was built specifically to realize this possibility by implementing a Turing-complete programming language capability to implement smart contracts."
