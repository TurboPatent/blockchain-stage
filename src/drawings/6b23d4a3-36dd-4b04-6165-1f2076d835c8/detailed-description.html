Each block records a collection of transactions.&nbsp;Blockchains distribute these transactions across a group of computers. Each computer maintains its own copy of the blockchain transactions.
</p>
<p>A&nbsp;blockchain is a continuously growing list of&nbsp;records, called&nbsp;blocks, which are linked and secured using&nbsp;cryptography.&nbsp;Each block typically comprises a&nbsp;cryptographic hash&nbsp;of the previous block,
  <span></span>a&nbsp;timestamp, and transaction data.&nbsp;By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. Blockchains may implement an open,&nbsp;distributed ledger&nbsp;that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.
</p>
<p>A blockchain is typically managed by multiple parties collectively adhering to a&nbsp;protocol&nbsp;for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus among the operators.</p>
<p>Cryptography involving mathematical methods of keeping data secret and proving identity is utilized when recording transactions. One digital key ensures only an owner can enter a transaction to the blockchain involving their assets, and another digital key lets other parties confirm it really was the owner who added the transaction.</p>
<p>Blockchain is resistant to tampering or other changes by utilizing a cryptographic technique called the hash. Hashing&nbsp;reduces data to a sequence of seemingly random characters -- for example, the&nbsp;hash of the phrase &quot;the quick brown fox&quot;&nbsp;is &quot;9ECB36561341D18EB65484E833EFEA61EDC74B84CF5E6AE1B81C63533E25FC8F&quot; using a hash method called SHA-256. Tweaking just one letter in the phrase produces a completely different hash, and you can&#39;t go backward to figure out the original data from the hash.</p>
<p>With blockchain, hashes are linked together so any minute change is immediately visible, not just for the block housing it but for all other blocks added later. With red flags that big for changes that small, auditing becomes easier.</p>
