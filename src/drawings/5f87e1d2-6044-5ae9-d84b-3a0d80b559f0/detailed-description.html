There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Because blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and because there are incentives to work only on extending with new blocks rather than overwriting old blocks, the probability of an entry becoming superseded goes down exponentially&nbsp;as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.&nbsp;For example, in a blockchain using the&nbsp;proof-of-work system, the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is always considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of&nbsp;computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;manner.
